<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> Introduction to Big Data Analytics</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Big Data Analytics is closely related to Business Analytics (BA) which is a quite new area within the field of economics. BA can be defined as the methods used to transforming data into knowledge for making better decisions. The methods used in BA is not new, and have been a part of topics within the economic field for decades. When the new term BA some time back became very popular, we can say that the main difference, or what BA presented as a new to the field of economics, is Big Data. Although many of the same quantitative, statistical methods are the same, what has changed is that companies now have huge amounts of data available which can be utilized to solve business problems and improve their decision making.</p>
<p>To give a definition of Big Data Analytics we should start by giving a definition of Big data. The most common definition of Big Data is the three V’s: ,  and . These are illustrated in Figure  and described below.</p>
<p>Recently there have been developments in the definition of Big Data, and additional two V’s are included in some settings:</p>
<p>Some of the points above, defining Big Data, are about the properties of the data. But, as we can see some of them also says something about the use and the utility that the data brings. So, what is the definition of Big Data Analytics? It is about utilising data that meets the criteria in the list above. Moreover, we can say that Big Data Analytics refers to utilizing any set of data which is to large and complex to be handled by any standard data-processing techniques and software. Hence, what we will consider as Big Data today, might not be seen as Big Data in the future, caused by developments in data-processing and software.</p>
<p>Within the area of Big data analytics there exists a vast amount of different methods and models, and the number is growing. When talking about analytics, a traditional way of categorizing different levels of analysis is to divide them into ,  and :</p>
<p>Big data analytics is highly influenced by computer-tools available, because they makes it possible to handle Big data, and to extract information used in an analytics setting. Alongside the vast development in available data (into Big Data), there have been, and still are, a high speed development in tools (software) which makes it possible to utilize Big data within Big data analytics. Some of the most used software tools lately are e.g. hadoop, spark, hive+++ and R. However also more general data software as for example Microsoft Excel, also provide new tools which can be used in Big data analytics.</p>

One can ask how useful/powerful is Big Data analytics? Is it enough to have huge amounts of data? Of course not. To utilize the real power of Big Data analytics we need to treat the data accordingly to sound methods to be able to utilise the possibilities… In this section we will look at some examples of big data analytics projects representing failures and successes.</p>
<p>Amazon, Starbucks, Netflix and Google are all companies that utilize huge amounts of data on their customers behaviour. When people get advertisement from Amazon, or what pops up when you google are all determined based on their behaviour. When Netflix recommend films and TV-shows to the subscribers it is determined by previous choice on what to watch.</p>
<p>Also theme parks like Disney collects big data amounts to plan and organize their parks. Visitors get a bracelet which monitors peoples movements. In combination with cameras all around the park, they can use big data to monitor how many people to let into the park, and at what time.</p>
<p>Within sports, e.g. tennis we can also see that data is used in ruling, and to retrieve vital information about how the players preform. If you look at Wimbledon, one of the grand slam tennis tournaments, you can see that the system  is used to decide if a ball is inside or outside the lines. This is a system with cameras which constantly collect information on the balls movement, and can vision-processing/visually track the trajectory of the balls, and then display a profile of the statistical most likely path. This system is not only used in tennis, but also in other various sports such as cricket, badminton and volleyball. Another example, also from tennis is IBM Slam Tracker, which is used to provide real-time scores, statistics and detailed analysis of tennis matches. </p>
<p>Bernard Marr, the author of the book  , states that it is easy to underestimate the time and effort it takes to train people to be able to utilize data. Not enough to have huge amounts of data. Hence, a organisation can have petabytes of data stored about their customers. However, if the company do not have any skills on how to analyse the data, the value is probably almost zero.</p>
<p>In the start of Big data analytics, this was mainly the domain for data scientists. In recent years and in he future, one of the focus and/or developments is to bridge the technical- and the business world. This is crucial if we want to utilise the opportunities that arise from collecting, analysing and display huge amount of data.</p>
<p>To secure that a data analytic project is successfully, it is important to have a plan for the process in the project. Figure  describes the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP) [site Shearer, 2000], and consists of six . It consists of six steps that breaks the important tasks in the project into phases.</p>
<p>An organisation or a company that work with big data analytics and have resources with data analytical skills, also need to decide how to structure their analytical teams. In Franks (2012),  he discuss what is a good analytical team and how should this team be structured within the organisation. One way to approach this is to divide the alternatives of structure into decentralized, centralized or hybrid:</p>
<p>Figure  gives an overview of the five stages suggested by  in a companies maturity when it comes to analytics: , , ,  and . At which stage a company or organisation will of course differ between type of business we look at. Some companies will never need or desire to reach stage five. Each company or organisation which whish to aspire to at higher maturity stage in analytics, should first figure out where they are today, and then in which direction they company should move in the future.</p>
<p>
The development within big data over the last years has introduced the need for important considerations, both within legal and ethical issues in context of collecting, storing and analysing large amounts of data. When e.g. a company are collecting data about their customers, it is obligated to protect the data and also making sure that they are not misused. Within the legal aspect there have been a development of data privacy laws in the resent years. One important example of a strict data privacy law is the General data Protection Regulation (GDPR),  which went into effect in the EU in May 2018. Some of the main issues the law handles are:</p>
<p>Companies, people or organisations that collects, stores and handles data for different purposes, all have the responsibility to understand the laws (e.g. GDPR) connected to these activities. Further, there are also some ethical issues that arise and which should be considered just as carefully as the legal issues. The ethical issues are not explicitly handled in rules/laws, but it is still very important for the ones handling data to consider this carefully. if not, the company, organisation or person might lose credibility. Ethical issues to be considered could be:</p>
<p>Finally, for companies and organisations that collects big data as an important part of their business, data security is not only important in the context for legal and ethical issues. Unauthorised access to data, or a data breach could be costly. In Camm et al. (2000) they refer to a study by IBM and the Ponemon Institute who estimated that the average cost of a data breach is $3.86 million .</p>
<p></p>
<p>Trends: increasing use of big data analytics wihtin industries already utilizing the porwer of big data analytics. And further, also more industries and areas in the society are moving into the use of big data analytics.</p>
<p>Better skills in analysing data. Also, the more data we collect and store, the more likely it will be that data is being misused or that data falls into the wrong hands not intended to have access to the data initially. This makes the areas of security, legal and ethical considerations, and the compentence of these apsects more and more important.</p>
<p>Some people within the big data analytics area claims that in few years from now, it is likely that big data analytics will be so pervasive in the society, the industry, all kinds of businesses and also in governments that this competence will no longer be the domain only for the specialists. Workers who today are expected to know spreadsheets, porwerpoint and basic ICT, will be expected to be competent working wiht big data. Not everyone will have to be a data scientist. The development within tools will make big data analysis available broadly.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the section above, it is expected that big data analytics in the future will influence larger and larger part of the scociety. Some of the typical positions connected to big data analytics that we know about today is: Big data analytics, Business consultant, Big data analytics architect, Big data engineer, Big data soulution architect, Big data analyst, Analytics associate, Business intelligence and analytics consultant, Metrics and analytics specialist and so on….</p>
<p>The field of big data analytics is developing fast and probably the skill sett required will further develop in the future. Based on requirements we know are needed today are: Basic programming, Statistical and quantitative analysis, Data warehousing, Data visualization, Specific business knowledge and computational frameworks. If the predictions about a increasing need and demand for big data analytics in the future is true, it is also important that there exists competence which can contribute to bridge the technical- and the business world. Further, increasing use of big data in every part of the society, will also bring knew challenges to data security and regulations on data collection, data use and data storage. It probably will be a need for people able to bridge the gap between the technical- and the business world, and also against the “legal” world (legislation, regulations).</p>
<p>Also within economics and business administration big data analytics has an increasing impact.</p>
