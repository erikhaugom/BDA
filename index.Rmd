# Introduction to Big Data Analytics


\section{What is Big Data Analytics?}\index{Big Data Analytics: definition}

Big Data Analytics is closely related to Business Analytics (BA) which is a quite new area within the field of economics. BA can be defined as the methods used to transforming data into knowledge for making better decisions. The methods used in BA is not new, and have been a part of topics within the economic field for decades. When the new term BA some time back became very popular, we can say that the main difference, or what BA presented as a new to the field of economics, is Big Data. Although many of the same quantitative, statistical methods are the same, what has changed is that companies now have huge amounts of data available which can be utilized to solve business problems and improve their decision making. 

\subsubsection{Definition of Big Data Analytics}
To give a definition of Big Data Analytics we should start by giving a definition of Big data. The most common definition of Big Data is the three V's: \emph{Volume}, \emph{Velocity} and \emph{Variety}. These are illustrated in Figure \ref{Fig:3vs} and described below.

\medskip
\medskip

\begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Volume}: Huge amounts for data. The size of the data amount is to large for any standard data solutions to handle.
        \item \emph{Velocity}: Large amounts of data are updated in very high speed. Makes it necessary to analyse and structure data close to real time
        \item \emph{Variety}: Data comes in different formats, and from different sources. The format of the data can be audio, text, structured data or unstructured data and it can originate from sources such as web-pages, internal data in the businesses own systems or surveys. 
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\medskip
\medskip

Recently there have been developments in the definition of Big Data, and additional two V's are included in some settings: 

\medskip
\medskip

\begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Veracity}: This is about how much uncertainty is in data. This could be missing values, measurement errors or inconsistency in unit of measures. This makes the high complexity of the data. 
        \item \emph{Value}: In the context of Big Data, it should also give some value to the company using them.  
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\medskip

Some of the points above, defining Big Data, are about the properties of the data. But, as we can see some of them also says something about the use and the utility that the data brings. So, what is the definition of Big Data Analytics? It is about utilising data that meets the criteria in the list above. Moreover, we can say that Big Data Analytics refers to utilizing any set of data which is to large and complex to be handled by any standard data-processing techniques and software. Hence, what we will consider as Big Data today, might not be seen as Big Data in the future, caused by developments in data-processing and software.  

\subsubsection{Categorization of methods models (Descriptive, Predictive, Prescriptive, diagnostic)} 
Within the area of Big data analytics there exists a vast amount of different methods and models, and the number is growing. When talking about analytics, a traditional way of categorizing different levels of analysis is to divide them into \emph{Descriptive}, \emph{Predictive} and \emph{Prescriptive}:

\medskip
\medskip

\begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{Descriptive}: At this level the typical past is to answer questions about what have happened, and includes reporting. Questions raised in an analysis could typically be: 1) Which company performed best in the last year (highest productivity and/or efficiency)? 2) How did the company perform last year compared to previous years? 
        \item \emph{Predictive}: At this level we try to predict future outcomes. This is at a higher level, and is more difficult to conduct. Typical questions could be: 1) What is expected revenue for the company next year? 2) What is the expected return on the company's investments the nest years? 
        \item \emph{Prescriptive}: At this level the analysis get operational because we at this level combine the knowledge of the future, the present and the predictions of the future. Examples: 1) Last year the company gained on this specific product. We know that the market demand is about to change for similar products. What is the prediction of the market demand in the future, and what can we use in the future from the success we experienced with the former product? 2) We know what our customers like, how could we utilize this knowledge to give our customers specialized offers? 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Tools and techniques in big data analytics} 
Big data analytics is highly influenced by computer-tools available, because they makes it possible to handle Big data, and to extract information used in an analytics setting. Alongside the vast development in available data (into Big Data), there have been, and still are, a high speed development in tools (software) which makes it possible to utilize Big data within Big data analytics. Some of the most used software tools lately are e.g. hadoop, spark, hive+++ and R. However also more general data software as for example Microsoft Excel, also provide new tools which can be used in Big data analytics.

\section{Business Value of Big Data Analytics}\index{Business Value}
One can ask how useful/powerful is Big Data analytics? Is it enough to have huge amounts of data? Of course not. To utilize the real power of Big Data analytics we need to treat the data accordingly to sound methods to be able to utilise the possibilities... In this section we will look at some examples of big data analytics projects representing failures and successes.   

\subsubsection{Examples of Big Data Analytics Projects (failures and successes)}

Amazon, Starbucks, Netflix and Google are all companies that utilize huge amounts of data on their customers behaviour. When people get advertisement from Amazon, or what pops up when you google are all determined based on their behaviour. When Netflix recommend films and TV-shows to the subscribers it is determined by previous choice on what to watch. 

Also theme parks like Disney collects big data amounts to plan and organize their parks. Visitors get a bracelet which monitors peoples movements. In combination with cameras all around the park, they can use big data to monitor how many people to let into the park, and at what time.

Within sports, e.g. tennis we can also see that data is used in ruling, and to retrieve vital information about how the players preform. If you look at Wimbledon, one of the grand slam tennis tournaments, you can see that the system \emph{Hawk-eye} is used to decide if a ball is inside or outside the lines. This is a system with cameras which constantly collect information on the balls movement, and can vision-processing/visually track the trajectory of the balls, and then display a profile of the statistical most likely path. This system is not only used in tennis, but also in other various sports such as cricket, badminton and volleyball. Another example, also from tennis is IBM Slam Tracker, which is used to provide real-time scores, statistics and detailed analysis of tennis matches. \emph{"IBM SlamTracker’s “Keys to the Match” feature is built using IBM’s predictive analytics technology (SPSS). The system analyzes over 12 years of Slam Tennis data analyzing players’ historical head-to-head match-ups, as well as against players with similar styles to determine what the data indicates each player must do to do well in the match."}  

Bernard Marr, the author of the book \emph{The intelligence revolution} \cite{marr2019l}, states that it is easy to underestimate the time and effort it takes to train people to be able to utilize data. Not enough to have huge amounts of data. Hence, a organisation can have petabytes of data stored about their customers. However, if the company do not have any skills on how to analyse the data, the value is probably almost zero. 


In the start of Big data analytics, this was mainly the domain for data scientists. In recent years and in he future, one of the focus and/or developments is to bridge the technical- and the business world. This is crucial if we want to utilise the opportunities that arise from collecting, analysing and display huge amount of data.    

\subsubsection{Developing successful data mining projects: CRISP}
To secure that a data analytic project is successfully, it is important to have a plan for the process in the project. Figure \ref{Fig:Crisp} describes the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP) [site Shearer, 2000], and consists of six \emph{steps}. It consists of six steps that breaks the important tasks in the project into phases.

\medskip
\medskip

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Business understanding}: You need to have an understanding of the business before you start planning the business analytic project. This is about knowing the problems the current business is facing, and to clearly define what is to be solved in the project.   
    \item \emph{Data understanding}: You need to be able to identify what data you need, how the attributes of the available data is, and the quality. In some situations you might need to collect additional data, and to do this you need to have a understanding of existing available data to find out what are missing. Also, data can come in different formats, quality and they can have been collected for different purposes, not connected to the business analytic project at hand. 
    \item \emph{Data preparation}: Often data stems from different sources, in different formats and with different quality. In most cases it will be necessary to clean-, converting-, remove- or normalize data. 
    \item \emph{Modelling}: In this phase the project must decide which model to use to reach the goals in the analytical process. The outcome of the business analytical project depends on the modelling. 
    \item \emph{Evaluation}: To secure that the results from the chosen model are correct and in accordance with the goals in the project, the evaluation phase are important to test that the outcome from the model are valid and reliable. Often this part of the project are done in a controlled environment before the model is deployed in a business process. 
    \item \emph{Deployment}: The last phase of the business analytical project is to deploy the model into reality. This step comes after the other phases. In Figure ??  the arrows indicates that several steps involves going back to earlier stages/steps in the project. E.g. after the step \emph{Evaluation}, one might need to go back to \emph{Business Understanding} to correct errors or misunderstanding in the earliest phase of the business analytical project. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Team and Culture}

An organisation or a company that work with big data analytics and have resources with data analytical skills, also need to decide how to structure their analytical teams. In Franks (2012), \cite{franks2012} he discuss what is a good analytical team and how should this team be structured within the organisation. One way to approach this is to divide the alternatives of structure into decentralized, centralized or hybrid:

\medskip
\medskip

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Centralized structure}: In this structure, all of the analytically competence withing the organization is gathered into one division/unit of the organisation, and will consist of various analytical skills in areas such as marketing, operations, sales and so on. This unit will then support all the other units within the organisations with their analytical needs. 
    \item \emph{Decentralized structure}: As the name might suggest, with this type of structure the analytical competence within the organisations. This means that people with analytical skills will be working in different departments, such as marketing, operations, sales...
    \item \emph{Hybrid structure}: In a hybrid structure we find a combination of the centralized and decentralized structures mentioned above. For example, in this type of structure, the organisation can have on centralised unit which is responsible for the overall analytical tasks in the organisations, and in addition there are some people with analytical competence within department of the organisation.  
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\medskip

Figure \ref{Fig:analytic_maturity} gives an overview of the five stages suggested by \cite{davenport2017} in a companies maturity when it comes to analytics: \emph{analytically impaired}, \emph{locaized analytics}, \emph{analytics aspirations}, \emph{analytical company} and \emph{analytcial competitor}. At which stage a company or organisation will of course differ between type of business we look at. Some companies will never need or desire to reach stage five. Each company or organisation which whish to aspire to at higher maturity stage in analytics, should first figure out where they are today, and then in which direction they company should move in the future.

\section{Legal and ethical issues in Big Data Analytics}\index{Legal issues}
The development within big data over the last years has introduced the need for important considerations, both within legal and ethical issues in context of collecting, storing and analysing large amounts of data. When e.g. a company are collecting data about their customers, it is obligated to protect the data and also making sure that they are not misused. Within the legal aspect there have been a development of data privacy laws in the resent years. One important example of a strict data privacy law is the General data Protection Regulation (GDPR), \index{General data Protection Regulation (GDPR)} which went into effect in the EU in May 2018. Some of the main issues the law handles are: 

\medskip
\medskip

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Request for consent}: Individual's must consent that data about them are being used/collected.
    \item \emph{Easy to understand}: The request for consent must be easily understood and accessible.
    \item \emph{Intended use}: The intended use of data must be specified.
    \item \emph{Withdraw consent}: Individual's have the right to withdraw their consent, and this must be easy to do.
    \item \emph{Copy of data collected}: individual's has the right to a copy of their data. 
    \item \emph{Be forgotten}: The GDPR also stipulates that individual's has the right to be "forgotten", meaning that they have the right to demand that their data be erased. 
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\medskip

Companies, people or organisations that collects, stores and handles data for different purposes, all have the responsibility to understand the laws (e.g. GDPR) connected to these activities. Further, there are also some ethical issues that arise and which should be considered just as carefully as the legal issues. The ethical issues are not explicitly handled in rules/laws, but it is still very important for the ones handling data to consider this carefully. if not, the company, organisation or person might lose credibility. Ethical issues to be considered could be: 

\medskip
\medskip

\begin{itemize} 
    \item \emph{Protecting data}: It is important that data being collected are protected to prevent sensitive data from going astray and being misused.   
    \item \emph{Validity}: Analyst must provide valid conclusions and recommendations that are easily understood. 
    \item \emph{Transparency in}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item how the data are collected
        \item what the data contain and do not contain
        \item which methods are being used in analysing data
        \item which assumptions had to be made for the methods used
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\medskip

Finally, for companies and organisations that collects big data as an important part of their business, data security is not only important in the context for legal and ethical issues. Unauthorised access to data, or a data breach could be costly. In Camm et al. (2000) they refer to a study by IBM and the Ponemon Institute who estimated that the average cost of a data breach is \$3.86 million \cite{Camm2020}.



\section{Future Prospects}\index{Future prospects}

Trends: increasing use of big data analytics wihtin industries already utilizing the porwer of big data analytics. And further, also more industries and areas in the society are moving into the use of big data analytics. 

\subsubsection{Facts + statistics}
Better skills in analysing data. Also, the more data we collect and store, the more likely it will be that data is being misused or that data falls into the wrong hands not intended to have access to the data initially. This makes the areas of security, legal and ethical considerations, and the compentence of these apsects more and more important. 

\medskip
\medskip

Some people within the big data analytics area claims that in few years from now, it is likely that big data analytics will be so pervasive in the society, the industry, all kinds of businesses and also in governments that this competence will no longer be the domain only for the specialists. Workers who today are expected to know spreadsheets, porwerpoint and basic ICT, will be expected to be competent working wiht big data. Not everyone will have to be a data scientist. The development within tools will make big data analysis available broadly. 

\subsubsection{jobs/careers and skill sett required}
As mentioned in the section above, it is expected that big data analytics in the future will influence larger and larger part of the scociety. Some of the typical positions connected to big data analytics that we know about today is: Big data analytics, Business consultant, Big data analytics architect, Big data engineer, Big data soulution architect, Big data analyst, Analytics associate, Business intelligence and analytics consultant, Metrics and analytics specialist and so on.... 

The field of big data analytics is developing fast and probably the skill sett required will further develop in the future. Based on requirements we know are needed today are: Basic programming, Statistical and quantitative analysis, Data warehousing, Data visualization, Specific business knowledge and computational frameworks. If the predictions about a increasing need and demand for big data analytics in the future is true, it is also important that there exists competence which can contribute to bridge the technical- and the business world. Further, increasing use of big data in every part of the society, will also bring knew challenges to data security and regulations on data collection, data use and data storage. It probably will be a need for people able to bridge the gap between the technical- and the business world, and also against the "legal" world (legislation, regulations).

\medskip
\medskip

Also within economics and business administration big data analytics has an increasing impact. 

Examples of domains:
\medskip
\medskip

\begin{itemize} 
    \item \emph{Healthcare}: Reducing cost, predicting epidemics (pandemics), prevent diseases.   
    \item \emph{Telecom}: Analysing all calls, detect fraudulent behaviour.
    \item \emph{Insurance}: Risk assessments, fraud detachments, new products, customers insights. Marketing
    \item \emph{Government}: estimating trade etc..
    \item \emph{Finance}: Fraudulant detection, analyse normal vs unormal behaviour
    \item \emph{Automobile}: fitting sensors in engines, monotored to detect problmes
    \item \emph{Education}: Slowly adopting, but it is increasing. E.g. Track the performance of the students.
    \item \emph{Retail}: Amazon etc...
\end{itemize}
